# Web3 SmartContract and React
 
Built a SmartContract with react that:

Connects to a wallet (or multiple) in MetaMask <br/>
Performs transactions and records them (LocalStorage) <br/>
Used Vite in order to build/test (React) site <br/>
Used Hardhat in order to test and deploy the solidity contract <br/>
Styled the site/app from the ground up. <br/>
The site has responsive design<br/>
